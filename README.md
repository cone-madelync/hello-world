# hello-world
This is my very first project. I've been told to make this "READ ME file". I have no idea what i'm suppose to type if i don't even know that i'm making though?!
umm hello.. world? ive been told to write a little bit about my self, so here it goes. im going to make this quick because im trying to get through this tourrourial asap bcause im in the middle of a coding project. its due at the end of spring break. im on day 2 of 5 so yea im just trally frying to see how bootstrap node.io and git hub work and if they work together so yea but coding is life. bye
